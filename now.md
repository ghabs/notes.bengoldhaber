*Updated 5/03/2020*

I'm working at [HASH](https://hash.ai) - we're creating a multi-agent simulation platform to enable truly world scale simulations. I develop simulations and business strategies/ops. My current obsessive hobby is the best boardgame ever created, [[Twilight Imperium 4]].

I enjoy meeting people who are interested in simulations, forecasting, rationality, software engineering (the list goes on but I feel like this conveys the general memespace), so [please do reach out if you're interested in chatting](https://twitter.com/bengoldhaber).
