Pattern Languages convey expert solutions to laypeople. Pattern languages are crystallized [[Mental Models]]. In the example case in Knowledge Hydrant, it's a model of how to form an effective study group.

Pattern Languages have a consistent format.

- Picture: shows a representative example of the pattern.

- Intro: An introductory paragraph, which sets the context for the pattern.

- Problem Headline: three diamonds mark the beginning of the problem, followed by a headline that gives the essence of the problem. 

- Problem Body: Describes the empirical background of the pattern, the evidence, the different ways the pattern manifests.

[[Unaddressed in this article is how to recursively factor a pattern language into smaller patterns. For instance a pattern might give a solution - "I should lead with enthusiasm" - that I don't know how to implement - "how do I be enthusiastic"? Decomposing the solution into smaller patterns is an effective meta-pattern.::rmn]]

- Solution: Describes the structure needed to solve the problem in a given context. This is stated in the form of an instruction.

- Diagram: Shows the solution as a diagram.
    - The diagram can be a simple sketch, for instance
    - Related links: Three diamonds, to show the main body is finished, and then connections to other patterns needed to complete this pattern.

Pattern languages are a standardized format for expressing approaches to solving problems; like a series of lego's that when stacked together build a house - the house represents the solution!
