A joint statement from several moral philosophers in 2010 on what they believed to be the basic tenants of morality.

- Morality is a natural and cultural phenomenon
- The building blocks of morality are innate
- Moral judgements are often made intuitively
- Conscious moral reasoning plays multiple roles in our lives
- Moral judgements and behavior are often at odds
- There is no single part of the brain responsible for morality
- Morality varies across individuals and cultures
- Moral systems support human flourishing to varying degrees
    - Different systems support different levels of trust, [[cooperation]], and promotion of values. On this basis it's possible to make judgements between moral systems.
