- [[Efficient Market Hypothesis]] requires several things:
    - Agent diversity
    - An aggregation method
    - Incentives

- There are [[[[principle]] [[agent]]]] issues that also reduce agent diversity. The business of [[investing]] is about fees.
- The two keys to [[contrarian]] [[investing]] are an independent [[mindset]] and long-term orientation.
