To truly bring a book into your soul, to gain it as a [[paradigm]], is akin to [[talmudic]] study. It's a deep read and conversation with the author over weeks, months, years. This process is like [[Spaced Repetition]], where by deliberately building the ideas into my [[Recurring]][[context]],  I am building it into me.

[[There's something important here related to factoring. When designing an experience like this, the chunks of information need to be small to avoid overwhelming the user.::rmn]]

Religious sermons and meditation apps are two examples of engaging with content across time. Religious [[Communities of Practice]] create a context in which the ideas are embedded in the [[context]]. A meditation app is a modern take on this, where the meditations are preceded with a short talk by the guru. The user is encouraged to make this a daily practice.

[[Outside of developing new technology, how can I build practices and rituals for this type of relationship w/ text?::lmn]]


> To be transformed by a book, readers must do more than absorb information: they must bathe in the book’s ideas, relate those ideas to experiences in their lives over weeks and months, try on the book’s mental models like a new hat.
