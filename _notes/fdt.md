title: Functional Decision Theory

Treat your decisions as the output of a fixed mathematical function that answers the question "Which output of this very function would yield the best outcome".

Correct decision making centers on choosing the output of a decision function, instead of choosing the best physical action.
- [[Casual Decision Theory]] asks "Which physical act of mine causes the best outcome"

My interpretation is this lets an agent be self-reflective. In the [[prisoner's dilemma]] an FDT agent faced with its twin can reason that if its algorithm outputs cooperate, that's the best case, because the twin will do the same.
