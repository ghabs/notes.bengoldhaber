title: Charts for Charles
tags: decision organizations

A term that stuck with me from a management training I took in 2013. The CEO of a company was metrics oriented, and wanted teams to create and use charts and metrics to make their decisions. Months later, he learned a term was being employed for this type of work - charts for Charles. The charts were busy work, fake work, that didn't actually effect the decisions but were seen as window dressing to appease the boss. For example, any number of useful, good forecasting approaches/techniques end up being abandoned because of the friction cost, and if a PM is forcing it they don't get adopted.
