title: Build a SIR Model
---

I [wrote a short tutorial on creating a SIR model](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-sir-model-in-20-minutes-se1m3ypg) with [HASH](https://hash.ai). In it I detail how to create the initial agents, add contagion behaviors, and how to extend it with “policy” options like isolation and testing.

I'm very excited about using HASH to quickly test complex ideas, like epidemeological models, and get a sense for the likely outcomes under specific conditions. It's much easier to reason about a concrete simulation than abstractions - even simple models can be very illuminating and reveal second order outcomes.
