Hello and happy September! Here's what happened last month and what I was reading, watching, and thinking about.


## Highlights from August

Work-wise I spent most of August getting us ready to release [h.Cloud](https://hash.ai/cloud), our cloud environment for running simulations. It's the next step towards HASH's long term goals of running world scale simulations. If you'd like [early access sign up](https://sohostrategy.typeform.com/to/JftFRbaN) here - or shoot me an email.

I also created two simulations of note:

- [A simulation exploring the advantages of RapidTests](https://hash.ai/index/5f2c19d54951e8798edeb8cb/sir-infection-network-w-rapid-tests) in combating the Coronavirus over traditional, slower PCR tests. This is the type of simulation we want to build tools to support - quickly being able to compare alternative scenarios and get a qualitative understanding of tradeoffs on important issues. 
- A model of a [Distribution Warehouse](https://hash.ai/index/5f318ffa4951e83fbfdeba86/distribution-center), which was a fun foray into using automated route planning in a simulated environment.

And on a personal front I moved to San Diego! 

- Southern California is basically a different state from Northern California. It's hot, beautiful, and everyone has a pool. A week and a half in and I recommend it.
- I'm living in the suburbs for the first time in a ~decade. I like that I have a lawn.
- I put together an [Ikea Hack Desk](https://images.app.goo.gl/xfWDWsDCgdpc5jPS8) - a countertop with legs - and I'm really enjoying it. It's extremely sturdy, cheap, and has a beautiful wood finish. I used a Karlby countertop with Oddvald Trestles.

## #good-content

[Midnight Gospel](https://g.co/kgs/aZ17am): A bizarre show but one I really enjoyed. It's hard to put my finger on exactly what works about it; the closest comparison I can make is a blend between a podcast and an animated graphic novel.

[Intolerable Cruelty](https://g.co/kgs/VWC7Ti): Delightful. 

[The Black Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yCIDkFI7ew&list=PLGBVp7G8Q0aE3u1S4iPyyctFm7E1pcliF): I hit shuffle on my music and re-encountered the Black Keys, who I guess I had forgotten about but always really enjoyed.

[Corporate](https://g.co/kgs/mdJovF): It recently finished its third and final season, which was a masterpiece of nihilistic surrealist comedy. Probably my favorite comedy series of the past two years.

​	[The extended internet universe](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe): Introduced me to the term cozyweb, a moniker for the pseudo-private internet made up of small semi-closed communities that is my favorite part of the current internet landscape.

​	[On Strasserism and the Decline of the Left](https://archive.vn/YjoXJ): I ended up reading a lot of tracts last month about the ideological tension within the left - this was the one I keep coming back to. The description of the "Political Managerial Class" as a distinct actor seeking to advance its own class interests, potentially at the expense of the working class, rang true as a fault line splitting the modern left.

​	Kek Wars ([1](https://archive.vn/EURCO))([2](https://archive.vn/5FNUi))([3](https://archive.vn/wI6uT))([4](https://archive.vn/lPSN7)): On the other end of the horseshoe were you aware that the 2016 election was actually a battle between dueling occult forces, wielding powerful meme magic to reshape America? You weren't? Then you must have missed this epic four-part series describing the intersection of the consequences of globalization, 4Chan, and Chaos Magic. [My notes](https://bengoldhaber.com/notes/the-kek-wars).

​	[Epistemic Viciousness in Martial Arts](https://gilliankrussell.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/epistemicviciousness.pdf): Martial Arts as an institution can suffer from bad epistemics, inherent to the "sensei" model and deference to tradition. There's a really important underlying principle that "proximity to reality" is needed to avoid deluding yourself. Related: [Dominic Cummings on Effective Action.](https://archive.vn/ezDNr)
