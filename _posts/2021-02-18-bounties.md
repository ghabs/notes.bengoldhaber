Things I'll pay for!

## Meta
- 10% of any of those bounties for connecting me with someone that solves the bounty.
- 10% commission on any bounty you help me create and fulfill. This is dependent on the level of work you put in to create a bounty. A "you should do a bounty on X" would be less than a "here's a detailed description of why this would be valuable and a template to post".

## Software
- $75 for a chrome extension where I can paste text and it runs an arbitrary [textlint](https://github.com/textlint/textlint).

## Productivity
- $25 for a voice recording -> notes process that I adopt. Should be Mac compatible.
    - This could be a step by step guide, a set of apps + bash script, etc. I'll pay if I adopt, and will partially pay if I adopt some or all of it.
