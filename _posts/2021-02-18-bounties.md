Things I'll pay for!

You can [contact me](goldhaber.ben+bounties@gmail.com) to request more information about any of these tasks.

## Meta
- 10% of any of those bounties for connecting me with someone that solves the bounty.
- 10% commission on any bounty you help me create and fulfill. This is dependent on the level of work you put in to create a bounty. A "you should do a bounty on X" would be less than a "here's a detailed description of why this would be valuable and a template to post".

## Software
- $75 for a chrome extension where I can paste text and it runs an arbitrary [textlint](https://github.com/textlint/textlint).

## Productivity
- $25 for a voice recording -> notes process that I adopt. Should be Mac compatible.
    - This should be a combination of notes on what to do and software(ex. a set of apps + bash script), etc. I'll pay if I adopt, and will partially pay if I adopt some or all of it.

## FAQ

**What if I start working on the bounty and someone else submits before I finish?** You can email me and let me know if you want to work on one of these and how long you expect it to take - if you do I'll add a note mentioning it's being worked on.

**What happens if I send you something that I think fills the bounty and you don't?** I will thank you for thinking of me for this!
