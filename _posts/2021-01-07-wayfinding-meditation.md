title: Wayfinding Meditation
---

Wayfinding meditation is a free form style of meditation I've been practicing. I've found it to be surprisingly powerful practice. I start by settling into the space, closing my eyes, and noticing my breath. I then let my attention go to whatever arises, without direction or constraint, just following what feels right.

Things that tend to feel right:

- Following a thought 'to completion'. For instance noticing an unresolved thought/intention, engaging with it until I feel in full alignment around it.

- Being curious about thoughts and feelings. In particular if a thought arises, being curious about why it arose and what that means about the thought and its relation to the other things I've been thinking or feeling.

- Noticing felt senses and finding words or phrases that describe them, e.g. [Gendlin style focusing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focusing_(psychotherapy)).

- When two or more threads of thoughts/feelings feel in conflict, letting the parts 'dialogue', passing ideas and feelings back and forth.

- Replaying old memories and exploring the memory from my current perspective/[[mindset]]

It's hard to describe how this is different from just sitting. It's actually pretty close to just sitting! The key difference is the sense of gentle exploration and curiosity. Prior practice noticing and being curious about internal sensations helps. While I've described the process in verbal, explicit terms, to the extent I've been able to feel it in a non-verbal way, the experience has been 'deeper'.

I sometimes ask myself prompts during the meditation:
- What do I want at this moment?
- What do my toes/stomach/chest feel like?
- What does that thought mean?

I've consistently come away from wayfinding with insights and energy, and a feeling of internal spaciousness. I'm particularly excited about the experience of replaying old memories in a fresh way, which seems like [memory reconsolidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation#:~:text=Memory%20reconsolidation%20is%20the%20process,in%20the%20long%2Dterm%20memory.). It feels like a very natural way for the mind to understand the self, orient to the past in new ways, and grow.

If you're interested in trying it I'd recommend reading [Catherio's twitter](https://twitter.com/uncatherio/status/1337570547421442050) thread, which provides more examples and helpful resources.
