title: June 2020 Review
---
I feel like the theme of June was volatility. We're in a different world where institutions that have existed for decades suddenly feel like they're on their last legs.


## Excerpts from my June notes:
  - We publicly launched [HASH](http://hash.ai)! The reception was positive and we're seeing some impressive simulations from users.

  - My partner and I drove to Big Sur and hiked Buzzard Roost. It was beautiful and especially rejuvenating to be in nature after spending so many months cooped up indoors.

  - I authored a [pomodoro workflow that adapts ultraworking templates](https://twitter.com/BenGoldhaber/status/1275996174151847936) for use w/ Roam Research. 

## Good Content:
  - Fountainhead - you've got to get past the regressive gender politics, but it's a nice "opposite" to the current political zeitgeist.

  - 30 Rock - Maybe my favorite TV comedy. Hard to beat in terms of jokes per minutes.
  
  - Aziz Ansari: Right Now - it was filmed in 2019 and his commentary on racism and dating culture feels extremely topical in 2020.
  
  - Coen Brothers - Hail Caesar and A Serious Man were both excellent. I couldn't tell you what either were 'about'.

  - Harley Quinn - Man this is a great show. Animated comedy action set in the DC universe with a deep appreciative parodying of the canon 

  - In a conversation w/ a few friends I identified the "style" of poems I like:
    - [Lepanto](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47917/lepanto)
    - [The Isles of Greece](https://englishverse.com/poems/the_isles_of_greece)
    - [Gods of the Copybook Headings](http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_copybook.htm)
    - [If](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---)
    - [Invictus](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus)
