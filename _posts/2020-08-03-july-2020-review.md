title: July 2020 Review
---

Some personal highlights from the past month:

- I decided, [after polling friends and family](http://bengoldhaber.com/posts/where-to-move-poll), to move to a place where I've been assured summer never ends - San Diego. Recommendations for things to do, particularly COVID-safe activities, are appreciated!

- Published (in partnership with Owain Evans) a write up of the [Relay Game](https://bengoldhaber.com/posts/relay-game), an experiment we conducted in late 2018 where players would, in ten minute chunks, try to solve a math problem.

- I've started to slowly [share my working notes.](https://bengoldhaber.com/notes) I'm hoping to build a [digital garden](https://archive.vn/9ACwV) - all the cool kids are doing it - or at the very least have [some motivation to write more permanent notes](https://archive.vn/wip/smwJp) to my future self.

  

## Excerpts from my July Notes

- Three laws of behavioral genetics

  - All personality traits are to some degree heritable

  - The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of the genes. 

  - A substantial portion of the variation in complex human **behavioural** traits is not accounted for by the effects of genes or families

- From the Timeless Way of Building:
[[ 
> 
    Imagine yourself on a winter afternoon with a pot of tea, a book, a reading
    light, and two or three huge pillows to lean back against. Now, make yourself
    comfortable. Not in some way you can show to other people and say how
    much you like it. I mean so that you really like it for yourself.  
    You put the tea where you can reach it; but in a place where you can’t possibly knock it over. You pull the light down to shine on the book, but not too brightly, and so that you can’t see the naked bulb. You put the cushions behind you and place them, carefully, one by one, just where you want them, to support your back, your neck, your arm: so that you are supported just comfortably, just as you want to sip your tea, and read, and dream.

    When you take the trouble to do all that, and you do it carefully, with much attention, then it may begin to have the quality with no name.
